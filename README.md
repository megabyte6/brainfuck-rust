# Brainf*ck-rust

## About
Brainfuck-rust is a [Brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter I wrote to learn Rust.
Inspiration was taken from [Alexander Overvoorde's](https://github.com/Overv/bf) Brainf*ck interpreter on GitHub.
For more samples, see [brain-lang's examples](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/tree/master/examples). They have some pretty cool programs on there :)
